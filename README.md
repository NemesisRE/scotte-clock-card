# Clock Card (ScottE version)
Fork of [Clock Card](https://github.com/bouwew/clock-card) with small modifications to use plain Javascript date/time functions.

Should really take Locale as an input, but I was lazy.

## Usage
1. Install with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)
2. Add a Lovelace Resource
```
URL: /hacsfiles/scotte-clock-card.js
type: module
```
2. Add this to a manual card:
`type: 'custom:scotte-clock-card'`
3. Profit!
